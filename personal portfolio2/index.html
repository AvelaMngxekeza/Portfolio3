    <h3 class="about">
        My name is Avela  Songezo Mngxekeza,<br>
    I'm a designer and developer looking to advance my career in the design field,<br>

    I was born and reared in Cape Town's Khayelitsha neighborhood. Growing up, I had a unique perspective on the world since I had relatives that supported my job choices. I realized that everyone who has a problem can solve it using technology combined with design for that thing!<br>


    I discovered a passion for design in eighth school and decided to major in MGD (Media Graphic Design) in college,<br>
    I grew fascinated with the way people think, feel, and behave - and how products could help them live more satisfying lives - after skipping out due to my father's financial troubles at home. I create websites and mobile apps for individual people, clients, and the general public.<br>


    I am currently working as a UI/UX Designer (Intern) at Younglings Africa. I create websites and mobile apps for clients. I use Figma and have also learnt Adobe Illustrator,<br>
    Before joining Younglings Africa, I spent six months at CodeTelligence NPO learning how to design websites and mobile apps as well as coding with html, CSS, and java script,<br>
    Outside of design, I'm a huge battlerap fan, and I enjoy singing and writing poetry, as well as listening to music from the past to the present,<br>

    When I have the time, I am always willing to participate. Contact me and let's talk!<br>
